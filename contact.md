My name is Christopher Munoz, but you can call me Chris. I am an Electrical
Engineer at Analog Devices in Norwood, Massachusetts. I am currently pursuing a
Master's degree in Engineering with a specialization in Data Science.
I am very interested in Reinforcement Learning and various applications of Deep
Learning.
